# Automatic Image Deletion Feature

## Overview
When an order status changes to "complete" (when all clients are marked as received), all images associated with that order are automatically deleted from Supabase storage.

## How It Works

### 1. **Trigger Condition**
- Order status automatically changes to `OrderStatus.complete` when ALL clients in the order are marked as "received"
- This happens in the `updateClientReceived` method in `FirestoreDataSourceImpl`

### 2. **Image Deletion Process**
- When an order becomes complete, the `deleteOrderImages` method is called
- This method:
  - Retrieves the order and extracts all image URLs from all clients
  - Parses each image URL to extract the file path
  - Deletes each image from Supabase storage using the `remove` method
  - Logs the deletion process for debugging

### 3. **Error Handling**
- If image deletion fails, it doesn't break the order completion process
- Individual image deletion failures are logged but don't stop the process
- The order completion continues even if some images can't be deleted

## Code Flow

```dart
// In updateClientReceived method
if (allReceived && updatedClients.isNotEmpty) {
  newStatus = OrderStatus.complete;
  print('ðŸ”„ Order $orderId is now complete. Deleting images...');
  await deleteOrderImages(orderId);
  print('âœ… Images deleted for completed order: $orderId');
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Storage Management**: Automatically frees up Supabase storage space
2. **Privacy**: Removes client images when orders are completed
3. **Cost Optimization**: Reduces storage costs by cleaning up unused images
4. **Automatic**: No manual intervention required

## Testing

To test this feature:

1. **Create an order** with clients and upload images
2. **Mark all clients as received** (tap the checkmark on each client)
3. **Check the console logs** for deletion messages
4. **Verify in Supabase** that images are removed from storage

## Logs to Watch For

```
ðŸ”„ Order [orderId] is now complete. Deleting images...
Deleted image: [filePath]
Successfully deleted [count] images for order: [orderId]
âœ… Images deleted for completed order: [orderId]
```
